      <h3>Passport Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <p>The Playcraft Passport program (“Program”) sponsored by Krauss Craft, Inc.
(“Sponsor”) is designed to help you get the most out of your playground purchase.
We reward you for purchasing your commercial playground equipment from
Playcraft Systems. The following Rewards terms and conditions (these “Rewards
Terms and Conditions”) contain important information regarding the Program.
Please read the following Rewards Terms and Conditions carefully. These Rewards
Terms and Conditions are a binding agreement between you and Sponsor and will
govern your participation in any and all Program offers. Participation in the Program
constitutes your agreement to the Site Terms and Conditions, and the Site Privacy
Policy, which are incorporated herein. Being eligible for the Program entitles buyers
(“Buyers”) to take advantage of certain Program rewards (“Rewards”) that may
change from time to time and, which may be made available for limited times, as
determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right to modify
these Rewards Terms and Conditions at any time, without notice to you, so it is
important to check the Rewards Terms and Conditions periodically. Participation in
the Program and/or redemption of Rewards is considered acceptance of these
Rewards Terms and Conditions and any modified terms included therein. Sponsor
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, cancel, change, suspend or modify any
aspect of the Program and/or any Program Reward at any time, including the
availability of any Program Reward, without notice.</p>

      <h3>Program Period</h3>
      <p>This Program will continue until terminated, suspended, modified, or converted to
another rewards program by Sponsor (the “Program Period”).</p>

      <h3>Eligibility</h3>
      <p>Purchases of equipment must be handled by a Playcraft Systems Distributor. Project
must be proposed on or after Oct. 10, 2016 and before midnight December 31, 2016.
In addition, structures must ship by Feb. 13, 2017. Must be 18 years or older to
participate.</p>

      <p>Sponsor reserves the right to suspend, terminate, revalue or modify, without liability,
or notice to Buyers, all or part of the FREE value structure and offers and any
merchandise or service. Sponsor reserves the right to adjudicate all FREE item
discrepancies in its sole discretion, and the Buyers agree to abide with any such
adjudication.</p>

      <h3>Reward Conditions</h3>
      <p>Rewards may be taxable, depending on the value of the item and the federal, state,
and local tax laws applicable to Buyer. Buyers are solely responsible for reporting
such items on their tax returns and paying any associated tax liability. Buyers may
not assign or transfer any Rewards. Sponsor makes no warranty in any respect as to
any Rewards, merchandise or service available within the Program.</p>

      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, cancel, change, suspend, or modify
any aspect of the Program and/or any Reward at any time, including the availability
of any Reward, without notice. Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
terminate or suspend any Buyer’s participation in the Program for breach of these
Rewards Terms and Conditions, or for taking any actions that are inconsistent with
the intent of these Terms and Conditions. Sponsor reserves the right at its sole
discretion to prohibit any Buyer from participating in any aspect of the Program if
Sponsor deems or suspects that such Buyer has engaged in or has attempted to
engage in any of the following: (a) acting in violation of these Rewards Terms and
Conditions; or (b) damaging, tampering with or corrupting the operation of the
Program or Site; or (c) any inappropriate, uncooperative, disruptive, fraudulent,
potentially fraudulent, or unusual behavior or activity; or (d) activity deemed in the
sole discretion of Sponsor to be generally inconsistent with the intended operation
of the Program. Any decision Sponsor makes relating to termination or suspension of
any Buyer’s participation in the Program shall be final and binding in all respects.
Sponsor shall be the sole determiner in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or breach of
these Rewards Terms and Conditions or intent of these Rewards Terms and
Conditions.</p>

      <h3>Release</h3>
      <p>By participating in the Program, Buyers release Sponsor, its parent company,
subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers, advertising and promotions agencies and their
respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, “Released
Parties”) from any and all liability for any loss, harm, damages, cost or expense,
including, without limitation, property damages, personal injury and/or death,
arising out of or in any way connected to the Program and/or the use of any
Rewards.</p>

      <h3>Indemnification</h3>
      <p>Buyers agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sponsor and its representatives and
agents harmless from and against any and all third party claims, demands, liabilities,
costs or expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, arising from, or related to any
breach by Buyer of any of these Rewards Terms and Conditions or any violation by
